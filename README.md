# interviews

Things I've been asked to do during interviews, but with tests.

The first example (string_num_sum) is a commit-by-commit step-by-step walkthrough of how I would TDD something, watching things fail in different ways before implementing the solution.  The time that it takes to do this is not much at all, and often catches other problems along the way, such as a bad test:  "Why did that pass?"
